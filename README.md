# SkillzCollab Briefs Management System

A full-stack enterprise workflow platform developed during my internship at SkillzCollab. The system was designed to manage competition briefs, collaborative workflows, analytics, and recommendation features using Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and React (Next.js).

The platform supports secure authentication, RESTful APIs, workflow management, graph-based analytics, and recommendation-driven brief discovery.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "AI Marketing Campaign",
    "category": "Marketing",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "UI/UX Redesign Challenge",
    "category": "Design",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }
]
```

---

### Analytics Output Example

```json
{
  "total_briefs": 25,
  "active_briefs": 18,
  "most_influential_brief": "AI Marketing Campaign",
  "cascade_depth": 4,
  "branching_factor": 2.3,
  "structural_virality": 3.7
}
```

---

### Recommendation Output Example

```json
{
  "recommended_briefs": [
    {
      "brief_id": 12,
